# Contributing to arcp

Thanks for your interest in improving the Python SDK for ARCP. This
document covers how to report issues, propose changes, and get a change merged.

By participating you agree to the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Where changes belong

ARCP is two things in two places, and a change belongs to exactly one of them:

- **The protocol** — the wire format, message semantics, lease rules, error
  taxonomy, feature flags. These live in the
  [specification repository](https://github.com/agentruntimecontrolprotocol/spec).
  If your idea changes what goes *on the wire* or what a conformant runtime must
  do, it is a spec change — open it there, not here. This SDK implements the
  spec; it does not define it.
- **This SDK** — how the protocol is expressed idiomatically in Python:
  bugs, ergonomics, performance, missing-but-specified features, docs, tests.
  Those belong here.

When in doubt, open an issue here and we'll redirect if it's really a protocol
question.

## The golden rule: conform, don't extend

A change to this SDK must keep it a faithful client of
[ARCP v1.1 (draft)](https://github.com/agentruntimecontrolprotocol/spec/blob/main/docs/draft-arcp-1.1.md).
Concretely:

- **Don't invent wire behavior.** No envelope fields, event kinds, error codes,
  or feature flags that the spec doesn't define. If you need one, it's a spec
  proposal first.
- **Negotiate honestly.** Only advertise a feature flag in `session.hello` once
  the SDK actually implements it. The feature matrix in the README must match
  what the code negotiates — a row marked `Supported` is a promise.
- **Respect the semantics.** Sequence numbers stay gap-free and monotonic;
  `LEASE_EXPIRED` and `BUDGET_EXHAUSTED` stay non-retryable; the effective
  feature set is the intersection of client and runtime advertisements. Tests
  must not paper over a semantic the spec requires.
- **Stay layered.** This SDK controls runtimes. It does not expose tools (that's
  MCP) or export telemetry (that's OpenTelemetry). PRs that blur those layers
  will be asked to move the logic out.

## Reporting bugs

Open an issue with: the SDK version and Python version, the runtime you
connected to, a minimal reproduction (the smallest program that triggers it),
what you expected, and what happened. A failing test is the best possible bug
report. Wire-level traces (the envelopes exchanged) help enormously for protocol
behavior — redact any `auth.token` or provisioned-credential `value` first.

## Proposing a change

For anything beyond a small fix, open an issue describing the problem before
writing code, so we can agree on the approach. Small, focused PRs review faster
than large ones; if a change is big, say so early and we'll help break it down.

## Development setup

The SDK targets Python 3.11+ and is developed with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
as the package manager (the lockfile is `uv.lock`). Install uv, then clone and
sync the project — that creates a `.venv/` with all runtime and dev dependencies
pinned to the lock.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/agentruntimecontrolprotocol/python-sdk.git
cd python-sdk
uv sync --frozen --all-extras --dev
```

Optionally enable the local pre-commit gates (CI is the canonical gate; this is
a convenience):

```sh
uv run pre-commit install
uv run pre-commit install --hook-type pre-push
```

## Tests and conformance

Two layers must pass before a PR merges:

- **Unit tests** — this SDK's own suite:

  ```sh
  uv run pytest
  ```

- **Conformance** — the SDK's behavior against the reference runtime. New
  protocol-facing code (session negotiation, event sequencing, lease handling,
  error mapping) needs a test that exercises the real exchange, not a mock that
  assumes the answer. The in-tree conformance harness lives at
  `tests/conformance/` and runs as part of `uv run pytest`; the end-to-end
  suites under `tests/e2e/` drive the reference runtime over the in-process
  `MemoryTransport` and over `WebSocketTransport` on a loopback socket — no
  external server or environment variable is required. The full conformance
  matrix this SDK is measured against is published at
  [`docs/conformance.md`](docs/conformance.md).

CI runs both on every PR. A PR that changes which feature flags the SDK
negotiates must also update the README feature matrix in the same change.

## Coding standards

This repo uses Ruff for linting and formatting and Pyright for type-checking.
Run them locally before pushing:

```sh
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run pyright
```

Match the surrounding code. Public API changes need doc comments and an entry in
the changelog. Prefer clarity over cleverness in a library others build on.

## Commit and pull-request conventions

- Write focused commits with present-tense, imperative subjects
  (`add result_chunk reassembly`, not `added` / `adds`).
- Reference the issue a PR closes (`Closes #123`).
- Keep the PR description honest about scope and any spec sections touched.
- Rebase on the default branch and ensure CI is green before requesting review.
- Sign off your commits to certify the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/):

  ```sh
  git commit -s -m "your message"
  ```

## Releases

Releases are cut by maintainers. Publishing is automated: pushing a `v*` tag
triggers the `publish.yml` workflow, which builds the wheel with `hatch` and
uploads it to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/agentruntimecontrolprotocol/) via OIDC trusted
publishing. The SDK is versioned with semantic versioning independently of the
protocol version it speaks; a protocol version bump is noted in the changelog
when the negotiated ARCP version changes.
