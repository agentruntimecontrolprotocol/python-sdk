# reasoning_streams

A primary agent emits its reasoning as a `kind: thought` stream. A
mirror peer runtime subscribes, runs a smaller critic model on each
thought, and delegates `arcpx.mirror.critique.v1` events back into
the primary's session. Bounded by a token budget — when spent, the
mirror unsubscribes and the primary continues without critique.

## Before ARCP

Self-critique loops drift: there's no clean way to (a) expose just
the reasoning to a separate process for a second opinion, (b) cap
the rounds, (c) gracefully step back when the critic budget is
spent. Sidecar a "second LLM call" before each step and the
indirection burns tokens whether you need it or not.

## With ARCP

```python
# mirror peer subscribes to the primary's thought stream...
await client.envelope("subscribe", payload={
    "filter": {
        "session_id": [target_session_id],
        "types": ["stream.chunk"],
    },
})

# ...and delegates critiques back as namespaced events.
await delegate_critique(
    client, target_session_id=target,
    payload=CritiquePayload(severity="warn", summary="..."),
)
```

The mirror is a *peer runtime* (`agent_handoff: true`,
`subscriptions: true`, `trust_level: trusted`), not an Observer —
it both reads and writes back into the primary's session.

## ARCP primitives

- `kind: thought` reasoning streams — RFC §11.4.
- Subscriptions with type filter — §13.2.
- Custom extension event under `arcpx.<domain>.<name>.v<n>` — §21.1.
- `agent.delegate` for cross-runtime delivery — §14.
- `tokens.used` budget — §17.3.1.

## File tour

- `main.py` — boots primary + mirror, wires the critique queue.
- `config.py` — endpoints, budget, depth.
- `primary.py` — emit thoughts, fold inbound critiques into the
  next step. The reasoning step body is stubbed.
- `mirror.py` — subscribe, critique, delegate back.
- `extensions.py` — `arcpx.mirror.critique.v1` payload model.
- `budget.py` — token budget.

## Variations

- Multiple mirrors (security / factuality / style) subscribed in
  parallel; primary merges critiques by severity.
- Persist critiques to the SQLite sink in
  [subscriptions](../subscriptions) for
  drift analysis.
- Replace the critic LLM with a deterministic verifier (linter,
  type checker) that returns `severity` from a rule set.
